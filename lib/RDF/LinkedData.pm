=head1 NAME

RDF::LinkedData - Linked Data implementation default class

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.15_1

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.15_1';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

A simple L<Plack> server illustrates the usage nicely:

  use RDF::LinkedData;
  use Plack::Request;
  use RDF::Trine;

  my $parser = RDF::Trine::Parser->new( 'turtle' );
  my $model = RDF::Trine::Model->temporary_model;
  my $base_uri = 'http://localhost:5000';
  $parser->parse_file_into_model( $base_uri, 't/data/basic.ttl', $model );
  my $ld = RDF::LinkedData->new(model => $model, base=>$base_uri);

  $linked_data = sub {
    my $env = shift;
    my $req = Plack::Request->new($env);
    my $uri = $req->path_info;
    if ($req->path_info =~ m!^(.+?)/?(page|data)$!) {
        $uri = $1;
        $ld->type($2);
    }
    $ld->headers_in($req->headers);
    return $ld->response($uri)->finalize;
  }



=head1 METHODS

This module simply uses the default implementation in
L<RDF::LinkedData::ProviderRole>, and does nothing on its
own. However, there is a quirk which is only relevant to a developer
of this package.

=item with_role

I had to redefine L<Moose::Role>'s with due to a conflict with
L<Error> described in the documentation of the latter. Users will
never see this.
