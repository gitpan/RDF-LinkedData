RDF-LinkedData
--------------

This is a simple server framework for serving RDF Linked Data.
It follows the basic best practice recommendations with 303 redirects
from the URIs that point to the physical or abstract things to
documents that describe them. It is pretty stable in that it is being
used in production systems, but unstable in the sense that it is not
yet very clear if the API it provides is sensible.

There are other open issues too, in particular, not all content types
are supported and it may not quite do the right thing if the desired
the content type is not found.

It should be faster too. In particular, it should cache the query
result between the first URI request and the second request, since it
is the same data that is queried and returned.

The distribution contains a script called linked_data.psgi. This sets
up a basic Web server based on Plack, which is a modern
high-performance framework. Running this script with the plackup
utility will give you a web server with all the features of this
module. See the inline documentation of that script for more
information.

Currently, RDF::LinkedData contains several methods that superclass
may inherit to provide their own functionality. It is not quite clear
yet if this is the Right Way to do it, so the API of this module may
change.

The functionality when using this as a server is unlikely to change in
backwards-incompatible ways, so it may well be installed and used, and
is in fact in production use for its author.
